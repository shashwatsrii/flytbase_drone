# Project Summary

## Problem
Build a drone survey management system for coordinating multiple drones across global sites.

## Solution
- Web application with real-time monitoring
- Interactive maps for survey areas
- Flight patterns: Linear, Crosshatch, Perimeter
- Backend with audit logs and scheduled tasks

## Key Decisions

1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Simple deployment, easy maintenance
2. **WebSocket**: Real-time telemetry updates
3. **PostgreSQL**: Reliable database with spatial support
4. **Material-UI + Ant Design**: Quick development with rich components

## Safety Features

- Pre-flight checks (battery >30%, GPS satellites >6)
- Real-time alerts and mission abort
- Complete audit logging
- Configurable thresholds
- Stateless backend for scaling
- JWT authentication

## Development Tools

- AI assistance for code generation
- Pattern implementation
- Documentation creation
- Algorithm design

## Features

### Core
- CRUD operations for drones, missions, survey areas
- Multi-tenant with organization isolation
- Real-time telemetry
- Flight pattern generation
- Role-based access (Admin, Operator, Viewer)
- Dashboard analytics

### Technical
- Flyway migrations
- JWT authentication
- WebSocket support
- Global error handling
- Input validation
- Test scripts

## Additional Features

- Live telemetry with alerts
- Analytics dashboard
- Maintenance tracking
- Flight hours calculation
- Progress caching
- Automated testing

## Performance

- Database: Materialized views, indexes, JSONB storage
- Backend: Connection pooling, lazy loading, pagination
- Frontend: Code splitting, debounced inputs

## Summary

Complete drone survey management system with:
- Production-ready architecture
- Safety-first design
- Real-time capabilities
- Scalable implementation
